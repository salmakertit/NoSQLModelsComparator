# Creation of a NoSQL models Comparator using Machine Learning 

The goal of this project is  to be able to  tell if a model is "good" or "bad".
During this project, 

  -I Collected, cleaned, studied and interpreted large unstructured datasets of models.
  
  -I Defined qualitative & quantitative features for comparing datasets such as flexibility and complexity 
  
  -I Annotated each model based on the qualitative features only Used statistical technics for hypothesis testing of eventual correlations between features using Python in order to minimize key features and eventual error
  
  -I Visualized data using Tableau & Hackolade
  
  -I Implemented Machine Learning Algorithms : K-means & Random Forest using Python to navigate through final annotations and tell how a set of 500 models is bad or good, with a percentage of error of 0,4.
